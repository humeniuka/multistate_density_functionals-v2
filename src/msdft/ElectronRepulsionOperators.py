        Multi-state correlation energy according to the local density approximation.

        For a single electronic state it reduces to the correlation energy of the uniform
        electron gas. The functional form from [Chachiyo] is a simple and elegant parameterization
        of the correlation energy per electron of the uniform electron gas.
        It recovers the exact high density limit and fits the quantum Monte-Carlo results of
        [Ceperley&Alder] in the medium density range rather well.

        Taking the paramagnetic part of the correlation energy (spin polarization = 0) and
        replacing the electron density ρ(r) with the density matrix D(r), the multistate extension
        of the Chachiyo functional (Eqn.8 in [Chachiyo]) can be written in the following form:

        `f[D] = log(Id + b₁ D(r)¹ᐟ³ + b₂ D(r)²ᐟ³) D(r)` is a matrix funtional,
        which is calculated by diagonalizing D and applying the function f to the eigenvalues.

        - F(X²(r)) is the enhancement factor over LDA. It is a matrix function of the square of
          the dimensionless (reduced) gradient, X²(r) = (36π)²ᐟ³ ∇R(r)·∇R(r), which depends on

        The exchange-correlation matrix has to be symmetric/hermitian. Since the product of two
        matrices is not symmetric (unless the two matrices commute), the product of two matrix
        functions A and B that depend on D and ∇D, A[D].B[∇D], will not be symmetric,

        A.B with 1/2 (A.B+B.A). Therefore the GGA exchange-energy density
